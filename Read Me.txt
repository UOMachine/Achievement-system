100% plug and play. This system keeps track of simple achievements which are account based.

Your players can open the achievement gump by utilzing the command [MyAchievements
Your players can open other players achievements by utilizing the comment [Achievements
Staff can wipe all achievement data to start over by utilizing command [ResetAchievements

If you do not want players seeing other players achievements, in AchievementSystem.cs, approximately line 77, you would set "ViewOthersAchievements" to false. It is true by default

In the event you want to add a context menu entry to PlayerMobile.cs, approximately line 2292, you replace this:

				if (DisabledPvpWarning)
				{
					list.Add(new CallbackEntry(1113797, EnablePvpWarning));
				}

with

				if (DisabledPvpWarning)
				{
					list.Add(new CallbackEntry(1113797, EnablePvpWarning));
				}


				list.Add(new Server.Achievements.AchivementGumpEntry(this));

then, approximately line 2335, replace:


				if (curhouse != null)
				{
					if (Alive && curhouse.IsAosRules && curhouse.IsFriend(from))
					{
						list.Add(new EjectPlayerEntry(from, this));
					}
				}

with

				if (curhouse != null)
				{
					if (Alive && curhouse.IsAosRules && curhouse.IsFriend(from))
					{
						list.Add(new EjectPlayerEntry(from, this));
					}
				}

                		if (from is PlayerMobile)
                		{
                    			list.Add(new Server.Achievements.AchivementGumpEntry((PlayerMobile)from, this));
                		}
